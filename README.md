Proposal for CS wiki Redesign to University of Idaho
Redesigning and updating the CS wiki
Abstract: As a website designer and a CS major student, I can see the benefits that the
redesigned CS wiki page of the university can bring to the students, Computer Science
department and the University of Idaho.

Introduction: Goal is redesigning and upgrading the CS wiki page of the university by
incorporating innovative ideas.

Background: As a CS major student I have been using the CS wiki page of the university. After
doing detailed analysis of the website I have diagnosed the problems and possible solutions. As
we know that organization is judged by the website it owns. Wiki pages are even more important
than normal websites because it has the feature of going back to time in history. Therefore,
timely update of the wiki page and its activeness determines the strength of the organization.
